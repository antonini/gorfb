# gorfb

Remote Frame Buffer implementation in Golang. Please note that this is a work in progress and something I play with at the moment, it is not used in any production implementations (yet). At the moment the server side is provided with a client side being contemplated.

For an example to use this please look at [hduplooy/gorfb-examples](https://github.com/hduplooy/gorfb-examples) for some examles on how to use this library.
